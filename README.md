   cd "c:\01 Pratik\CLG\Projects\BILL SYSTEM\billing-system"
   ```

2. **Install Flask:**
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```
   
   Or using requirements.txt:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**

## 📖 How to Use

### 1. Add a Customer
- Click "Add New Customer" from the home page
- Fill in customer details (name, mobile, village, bank info)
- Click "Save Customer"

### 2. Add Services
- From the customer list, click "Add Services" for a customer
- Enter service name and charge amount
- Click "Add Service" (you can add multiple services)
- Click "Done" when finished

### 3. Record Payments
- From the customer list, click "Add Payment" for a customer
- Select payment date (defaults to today)
- Enter payment amount
- Click "Record Payment"

### 4. View & Print Bill
- From the customer list, click "View Bill" for a customer
- Review the complete bill with:

  - Total charges, received amount, and balance
- Click "Print Bill" to print

## 🧮 Business Logic

```
Total Charges = SUM(all service charges)
Total Received = SUM(all payments)
Balance = Total Charges - Total Received

If Balance == 0:
  Display: "एकूण येणे बाकी = 0/-"
```

## 📄 Bill Format

The bill includes:
- Consultancy header with date
- Customer information (name, mobile, village, bank, loan amount)
- Services table with itemized charges
- Payment history table

- No authentication or user management
- Data is stored locally in SQLite database
- All code is well-commented for learning purposes

## 👨‍💻 For Developers

The code follows a simple MVC-like pattern:
- **Model:** SQLite database (database.sql)
- **View:** HTML templates (templates/)
- **Controller:** Flask routes (app.py)
